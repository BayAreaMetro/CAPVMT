      <p>
      Local jurisdictions are putting forward solutions to the global problem of climate change through Climate Action Plans. These documents strive to first quantify the greenhouse gas emissions within a city's scope of influence and then put forward strategies to reduce emissions moving forward. The Bay Area Quality Management District has provided formal guidance to assist jurisdictions in developing these plans.

      <p>
      	A key component of local jurisdictions' greenhouse gas footprint is passenger vehicle travel. There is, however, no obvious approach to allocating the responsibility of the GHG from vehicle travel to individual jurisdictions. Several entities have put forward suggestions for how to approach this allocation, some of which the Air District notes in the guidance referenced above. 
      </p>
      <p>
      	The purpose of this data portal is to quickly and easily deliver consistent, jurisdiction-specific estimates of vehicle miles traveled. Importantly, this data is consistent with the travel outcomes associated with the Metropolitan Transportation Commission's long-range transportation plan, which meets a state-mandated GHG reduction target.
